**What's in a name?**

**Are you sure?**

**Look again.**

This is a toy Twitter bot that takes a message/missive/manifesto, breaks it up into name-sized chunks, and auto-updates my Twitter name with a new chunk every minute until the whole string has been shared. 

After a few rounds of this, the name is reset to something I'd like to leave in place more permanently.

"Twitter name" doesn't refer to the "@" handle. It's the other one, which can reflect a real name ("Duke Greene"), a cause ("#BlackLivesMatter"), snark ("Swagny Taggart"), raw emotion ("¯\\_(ツ)_/¯")... anything, really. 

I wrote this to see how "anything" my anything could become.

I don't know how "useful" this is to anyone else, but I like imagining some lonely lurker refreshing their app at the right moment, noticing a change, chasing their curiosity with more refreshes, and becoming suddenly aware that there might be more ways to communicate on Twitter than the designers originally intended. 

Clunky, obtuse, pretentious ways, maybe. But more of them nonetheless.

Maybe you can find a better one!
